# 🇮🇳 Indian Flag

A simple **web project** that displays the **Indian national flag** using **HTML and CSS** — built from scratch without any images, using only code.

This project visually represents the tricolour flag of India and is a beginner-friendly example of HTML layout and CSS styling.

## 📌 About

The Indian National Flag — known as the *Tiraṅgā* (meaning “tricolour”) — consists of three horizontal bands of saffron, white and green with a navy blue Ashoka Chakra in the center. This project replicates that flag purely with HTML and CSS code.
This repository is great for:

- 🧑‍💻 Practicing HTML & CSS layout
- 🎨 Learning visual design with code
- 🇮🇳 Understanding symbolism in web visuals

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

✔ **HTML5** — structure of the flag  
✔ **CSS3** — styling to draw each stripe and the Ashoka Chakra  

No images or JavaScript are used — all visuals are created with CSS styles.

### 🧠 How It Works
- The flag is made using:
- Three colored horizontal <div> sections representing:
  - Saffron (top)
  - White (middle)
  - Green (bottom)
  - A styled circle in the center representing the Ashoka Chakra (navy blue wheel).

This demonstrates how to use basic HTML and CSS shapes to form complex visuals.
